<div class='docblock'><p>Collection types.</p>

<p>Rust&#39;s standard collection library provides efficient implementations of the
most common general purpose programming data structures. By using the
standard implementations, it should be possible for two libraries to
communicate without significant data conversion.</p>

<p>To get this out of the way: you should probably just use <code>Vec</code> or <code>HashMap</code>.
These two collections cover most use cases for generic data storage and
processing. They are exceptionally good at doing what they do. All the other
collections in the standard library have specific use cases where they are
the optimal choice, but these cases are borderline <em>niche</em> in comparison.
Even when <code>Vec</code> and <code>HashMap</code> are technically suboptimal, they&#39;re probably a
good enough choice to get started.</p>

<p>Rust&#39;s collections can be grouped into four major categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequences: <code>Vec</code>, <code>VecDeque</code>, <code>LinkedList</code></li>
<li>Maps: <code>HashMap</code>, <code>BTreeMap</code></li>
<li>Sets: <code>HashSet</code>, <code>BTreeSet</code></li>
<li>Misc: <code>BinaryHeap</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These are fairly high-level and quick break-downs of when each collection

</ul>

<h1 id='performance' class='section-header'><a href='#performance'>Performance</a></h1>
<p>Choosing the right collection for the job requires an understanding of what
each collection is good at. Here we briefly summarize the performance of
different collections for certain important operations. For further details,
see each type&#39;s documentation, and note that the names of actual methods may
differ from the tables below on certain collections.</p>

<p>Throughout the documentation, we will follow a few conventions. For all
operations, the collection&#39;s size is denoted by n. If another collection is
involved in the operation, it contains m elements. Operations which have an
<em>amortized</em> cost are suffixed with a <code>*</code>.  Operations with an <em>expected</em>
cost are suffixed with a <code>~</code>.</p>

<p>All amortized costs are for the potential need to resize when capacity is
exhausted.  If a resize occurs it will take O(n) time. Our collections never
automatically shrink, so removal operations aren&#39;t amortized. Over a
sufficiently large series of operations, the average cost per operation will
deterministically equal the given cost.</p>

<p>Only HashMap has expected costs, due to the probabilistic nature of hashing.
It is theoretically possible, though very unlikely, for HashMap to
experience worse performance.</p>

<h1 id='correct-and-efficient-usage-of-collections' class='section-header'><a href='#correct-and-efficient-usage-of-collections'>Correct and Efficient Usage of Collections</a></h1>
<p>Of course, knowing which collection is the right one for the job doesn&#39;t
instantly permit you to use it correctly. Here are some quick tips for
efficient and correct usage of the standard collections in general. If
you&#39;re interested in how to use a specific collection in particular, consult
its documentation for detailed discussion and code examples.</p>

<h2 id='capacity-management' class='section-header'><a href='#capacity-management'>Capacity Management</a></h2>
<p>Many collections provide several constructors and methods that refer to
&quot;capacity&quot;.  These collections are generally built on top of an array.
Optimally, this array would be exactly the right size to fit only the
elements stored in the collection, but for the collection to do this would
be very inefficient. If the backing array was exactly the right size at all
times, then every time an element is inserted, the collection would have to
grow the array to fit it. Due to the way memory is allocated and managed on
most computers, this would almost surely require allocating an entirely new
array and copying every single element from the old one into the new one.
Hopefully you can see that this wouldn&#39;t be very efficient to do on every
operation.</p>

<p>Most collections therefore use an <em>amortized</em> allocation strategy. They
generally let themselves have a fair amount of unoccupied space so that they
only have to grow on occasion. When they do grow, they allocate a
substantially larger array to move the elements into so that it will take a
while for another grow to be required. While this strategy is great in
general, it would be even better if the collection <em>never</em> had to resize its
backing array. Unfortunately, the collection itself doesn&#39;t have enough
information to do this itself. Therefore, it is up to us programmers to give
it hints.</p>

<p>Any <code>with_capacity</code> constructor will instruct the collection to allocate
enough space for the specified number of elements. Ideally this will be for
exactly that many elements, but some implementation details may prevent
this. <code>Vec</code> and <code>VecDeque</code> can be relied on to allocate exactly the
requested amount, though. Use <code>with_capacity</code> when you know exactly how many
elements will be inserted, or at least have a reasonable upper-bound on that
number.</p>

<p>When anticipating a large influx of elements, the <code>reserve</code> family of
methods can be used to hint to the collection how much room it should make
for the coming items.  As with <code>with_capacity</code>, the precise behavior of
these methods will be specific to the collection of interest.</p>

<p>For optimal performance, collections will generally avoid shrinking
themselves.  If you believe that a collection will not soon contain any more
elements, or just really need the memory, the <code>shrink_to_fit</code> method prompts
the collection to shrink the backing array to the minimum size capable of
holding its elements.</p>

<p>Finally, if ever you&#39;re interested in what the actual capacity of the
collection is, most collections provide a <code>capacity</code> method to query this
information on demand.  This can be useful for debugging purposes, or for
use with the <code>reserve</code> methods.</p>

<h2 id='iterators' class='section-header'><a href='#iterators'>Iterators</a></h2>
<p>Iterators are a powerful and robust mechanism used throughout Rust&#39;s
standard libraries. Iterators provide a sequence of values in a generic,
safe, efficient and convenient way. The contents of an iterator are usually
<em>lazily</em> evaluated, so that only the values that are actually needed are
ever actually produced, and no allocation need be done to temporarily store
them. Iterators are primarily consumed using a <code>for</code> loop, although many
functions also take iterators where a collection or sequence of values is
desired.</p>

<p>All of the standard collections provide several iterators for performing
bulk manipulation of their contents. The three primary iterators almost
every collection should provide are <code>iter</code>, <code>iter_mut</code>, and <code>into_iter</code>.
Some of these are not provided on collections where it would be unsound or
unreasonable to provide them.</p>

<p><code>iter</code> provides an iterator of immutable references to all the contents of a
collection in the most &quot;natural&quot; order. For sequence collections like <code>Vec</code>,
this means the items will be yielded in increasing order of index starting
at 0. For ordered collections like <code>BTreeMap</code>, this means that the items
will be yielded in sorted order.  For unordered collections like <code>HashMap</code>,
the items will be yielded in whatever order the internal representation made
most convenient. This is great for reading through all the contents of the
collection.</p>

<pre class='rust rust-example-rendered'>
<span class='kw'>let</span> <span class='ident'>vec</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='macro'>vec</span><span class='macro'>!</span>[<span class='number'>1</span>, <span class='number'>2</span>, <span class='number'>3</span>, <span class='number'>4</span>];
<span class='kw'>for</span> <span class='ident'>x</span> <span class='kw'>in</span> <span class='ident'>vec</span>.<span class='ident'>iter</span>() {
   <span class='macro'>println</span><span class='macro'>!</span>(<span class='string'>&quot;vec contained {}&quot;</span>, <span class='ident'>x</span>);
}</pre>

<p><code>iter_mut</code> provides an iterator of <em>mutable</em> references in the same order as
<code>iter</code>.  This is great for mutating all the contents of the collection.</p>

<pre class='rust rust-example-rendered'>
<span class='kw'>let</span> <span class='kw-2'>mut</span> <span class='ident'>vec</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='macro'>vec</span><span class='macro'>!</span>[<span class='number'>1</span>, <span class='number'>2</span>, <span class='number'>3</span>, <span class='number'>4</span>];

   <span class='op'>*</span><span class='ident'>x</span> <span class='op'>+=</span> <span class='number'>1</span>;
}</pre>

<p><code>into_iter</code> transforms the actual collection into an iterator over its
contents by-value. This is great when the collection itself is no longer
needed, and the values are needed elsewhere. Using <code>extend</code> with <code>into_iter</code>
is the main way that contents of one collection are moved into another.
<code>extend</code> automatically calls <code>into_iter</code>, and takes any <code>T: IntoIterator</code>.
Calling <code>collect</code> on an iterator itself is also a great way to convert one
collection into another. Both of these methods should internally use the
capacity management tools discussed in the previous section to do this as
efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>Iterators also provide a series of <em>adapter</em> methods for performing common
threads to sequences. Among the adapters are functional favorites like <code>map</code>,
<code>fold</code>, <code>skip</code>, and <code>take</code>. Of particular interest to collections is the
<code>rev</code> adapter, that reverses any iterator that supports this operation. Most
collections provide reversible iterators as the way to iterate over them in
reverse order.</p>

<pre class='rust rust-example-rendered'>
<span class='kw'>let</span> <span class='ident'>vec</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='macro'>vec</span><span class='macro'>!</span>[<span class='number'>1</span>, <span class='number'>2</span>, <span class='number'>3</span>, <span class='number'>4</span>];

   <span class='macro'>println</span><span class='macro'>!</span>(<span class='string'>&quot;vec contained {}&quot;</span>, <span class='ident'>x</span>);
}</pre>

<p>Several other collection methods also return iterators to yield a sequence
of results but avoid allocating an entire collection to store the result in.
This provides maximum flexibility as <code>collect</code> or <code>extend</code> can be called to
&quot;pipe&quot; the sequence into any collection if desired. Otherwise, the sequence
can be looped over with a <code>for</code> loop. The iterator can also be discarded
after partial use, preventing the computation of the unused items.</p>

<h2 id='entries' class='section-header'><a href='#entries'>Entries</a></h2>
<p>The <code>entry</code> API is intended to provide an efficient mechanism for
manipulating the contents of a map conditionally on the presence of a key or
not. The primary motivating use case for this is to provide efficient
accumulator maps. For instance, if one wishes to maintain a count of the
number of times each key has been seen, they will have to perform some
conditional logic on whether this is the first time the key has been seen or
not. Normally, this would require a <code>find</code> followed by an <code>insert</code>,
effectively duplicating the search effort on each insertion.</p>

<p>When a user calls <code>map.entry(&amp;key)</code>, the map will search for the key and
then yield a variant of the <code>Entry</code> enum.</p>

<p>If a <code>Vacant(entry)</code> is yielded, then the key <em>was not</em> found. In this case
the only valid operation is to <code>insert</code> a value into the entry. When this is
done, the vacant entry is consumed and converted into a mutable reference to
the value that was inserted. This allows for further manipulation of the
value beyond the lifetime of the search itself. This is useful if complex
logic needs to be performed on the value regardless of whether the value was
just inserted.</p>

<p>If an <code>Occupied(entry)</code> is yielded, then the key <em>was</em> found. In this case,
the user has several options: they can <code>get</code>, <code>insert</code>, or <code>remove</code> the
value of the occupied entry. Additionally, they can convert the occupied
entry into a mutable reference to its value, providing symmetry to the
vacant <code>insert</code> case.</p>

<h3 id='examples' class='section-header'><a href='#examples'>Examples</a></h3>
<p>Here are the two primary ways in which <code>entry</code> is used. First, a simple
example where the logic performed on the values is trivial.</p>

}</pre>

<p>When the logic to be performed on the value is more complex, we may simply
use the <code>entry</code> API to ensure that the value is initialized, and perform the
logic afterwards.</p>
